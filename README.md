# IsoNoiose
This is programming part of my diploma thesis at GIS postgraduate studies called:
#### Noise propagation model. Implementation of International Standard ISO 9613-2 “Acoustics – Attenuation of sound during propagation outdoors – Part 2: General method of calculation”
It is ArcGIS Python Toolbox so to run you need ArcGIS Desktop software >= 10.0.
